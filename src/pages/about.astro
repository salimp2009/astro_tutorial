  <p>
    I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. <br /> This is the second
    page on my website, and <strong> it's the first one I built myself!</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="facts">Here are a few facts about me:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
    <li>
      I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}.
    </li>
    {
      identity.hobbies.length >= 2 && (
        <li>
          Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}
        </li>
      )
    }
  </ul>

  <p>{operatingSystem}</p>
  {student && <p>I am still in school.</p>}
  <p>I have {quantity + 8} pairs of {footwear}</p>
  {
    operatingSystem === "Linux" ? (
      <p>I am using a Linux.</p>
    ) : (
      <p>I am not using a Linux.</p>
    )
  }
  <p>My skills are:</p>
  <ul>
    {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
  </ul>
  <p>
    This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking
    back and see how my journey is going!
  </p>

  {happy && <p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p>}

  {finished === false && <p>I am not finished this tutorial!</p>}

  {
    goal === 3 ? (
      <p>My goal is to finish in 3 days.</p>

      <p>My goal is not 3 days.</p>
    )
  }
